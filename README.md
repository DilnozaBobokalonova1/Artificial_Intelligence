Unique solutions to various fun and fascinating coding assignments
1. Implemented a performance-measuring environment simulator
for the vacuum-cleaner world. My implementation is modular
so that the sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics
(size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) can be changed easily.
2. Implemented an appropriate Bidirectional Search algorithm for 
the missionaries and cannibals problem along with also creating a 
Finite State Automata for the problem. Click on the uploaded *.pdf file to see.
3. Solved the route finding problem between 2 points in a plane that has 8 convex
polygons as obstacles. Found the shortest path using an A* search. This is an idealistic 
navigation problem for a robot.
4. Implemented a Genetic Algorithm used to solve a Graph-Coloring Problem which belongs to 
the class of NP-Complete. Used 10 vertices and 4 colors. Could be used for more.
